# 10.7_API_NPS_Assignment
Your team is working on an app that will help folks plan a vacation. You've been assigned to work on one feature for the app - to display a list of national parks in an area.

Review The National Parks Services API documentation and create an API key: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/get-started.htm

Review the API Guide on Authentication for ways to pass your API key as part of the request: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/guides.htm

Review the /parks endpoint (https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/parks/getPark) and data model (https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/definitions/Park) to understand how it works.

The user must be able to search for parks in one or more states.
The user must be able to set the max number of results, with a default of 10.
The search must trigger a call to NPS's API.
The parks in the given state must be displayed on the page.
Include at least: Full name Description Website URL
The user must be able to make multiple searches and see only the results for the current search.
